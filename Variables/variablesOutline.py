#1)
#Make an example variable of each of the types of variables (int, float, 
#string, boolean and list):

#Integer

a=26

#Float

a=9.89

#String

a = "twilight"
name = "noah and lopez"

#Boolean

a = True
a = False

#List

a = [1, 2, 3, 4]
a = ["stringOne", "stringTwo"]
a = [True, False, True]
a = [1.1, 1.2, 1.3]

#2)
#Make two variables one named 'a' and one named 'A' both set to  different data:
#(Remember that capitalization matters, so these can be two different variables)

varA = 1
vara = 2

#3)
#Make a variable, and then go down a couple lines and change the data in that
#same variable:

A = 1

A = 2

#4)
#Make a variable and set it to a variable you have already created:

varTwo = varA

#5)
#Make a list with three items. Make a variable that is set to the second
#item in that list:

c = [12, 17, 96]
h = c[1]

#6)
#Make a String set to your name. Make a variable that is set to the first item
#in that list:

string = "noah"
n = string[0]

#7)
#Print out ONE of any of the variables you have created so far:

print(c)

#8)
#Make a variable of any type, with one of the common SYNTAX errors
