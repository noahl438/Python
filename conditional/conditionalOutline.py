#1) Make a int variable named a. Now make an if statement, and if a is more than
#5, print out "a is more than 5."
a = 46
if(a > 5):
    print("a is more than 5")

#2) Make a boolean variable named b. Now make an if statement, and if b is True
#print out "b is True."
b = True
if(b == True):
    print("b is true")
#3) Make an int variable named c. Now make an if/elif statement, and if c is 
#more than 0, print "c is positive". Else if c is less than 0, print "c is
#negative".
c = 28
if(c > 0):
    print("c is positive")
elif(c < 0):
    print("c is negative")

#4) Make an int variable named d. Now make an if/elif/else statement, and if 
#d is more than 0, print "d is positive". Else if d is less than 0, print "c is
#negative". Else, print "d is zero".
d = 2
if(d > 0):
    print("d is positive")
elif(d < 0):
    print("c is negative")
else:
    print("d is zero")


#5) Make an if statement with any comparison, with a common SYNTAX error.
x = 4
if(x > 0)
    print("coolio")
