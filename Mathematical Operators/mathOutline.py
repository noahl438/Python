#1) Make two string variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = "your" + " name"

#2) Make two int variables and use the + operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

x = 4 + 4

#3) Make two int variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

y = 4 - 3

#4) Make two float variables and use the - operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

z = 1.23 - 4.56

#5) Make two int variables and use the * operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

a = 3 * 19

#6) Make one string variable and one int variable and use the * operator 
#to combine them into one new variable.

b = "noah " * 3

#7) Make two int variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

c = 4 / 4

#8) Make two float variables and use the / operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

d = 4.12 / 4.12

#9) Make two int variables and use the % operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

e = 7 % 4

#10) Make two int variables and use the // operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

f = 4 // 4

#11) Make two int variables and use the ** operator to combine them into
#one new variable.

g = 4 ** 5

#12) Make any type of operation with a common SYNTAX error

p = "hi"  56
