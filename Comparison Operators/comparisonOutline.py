This outline will help solidify concepts from the Comparison Operators lesson.
Fill in this outline as the instructor goes through the lesson.

#1) Make two string variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
var = "one"
var1 = "two"

fin =  (var == var1)
print(fin)

#2) Make two int variables. Compare them using the == operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
x = 1
y = 2
xy = (x == y)
print(xy)

#3) Make two int variables. Compare them using the > operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
a = 1
b = 2
ab = (a > b)
print(ab)


#4) Make two int variables. Compare them using the < operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
c = 1
d = 2
cd = (c < d)
print(cd)

#5) Make two int variables. Compare them using the >= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
e = 1
f = 2
ef = (e >= f)
print(ef)

#6) Make two int variables. Compare them using the <= operator and store
#that comparison in a new variable. Then print the variable.
g = 1
h = 2
gh = (g <= h)
print(gh)

#7) Make a comparison with any operator, with one of the common SYNTAX errors.
